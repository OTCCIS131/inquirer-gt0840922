This is what you'll expect to do in the program:

    A user executes the program
    They are greeted with a friendly message from "My Super Awesome Pizza Co."
    They are asked which size pizza they'd like.
    They are asked which toppings they'd like.
    They are asked which sauce they want.
    Their order is repeated back to them with pretty colors.
    The program exits.

The End!
